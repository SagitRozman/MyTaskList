# My Task List

I based my solution on [react redux starter kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit).

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone myRepo
```

Then install dependencies and run:

```bash
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```
